			     ALARM CLOCK
			     ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

from thread.h:
- int64_t wakeup_tick: stores system tick count for thread wakeup time
- struct list_elem sleep_elem: links thread into global sleeping thread list

from timer.c:
- static struct list sleeping_list: global list that stores all sleeping threads (the list is ordered by wakeup time)

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

- When timer_sleep() is called, the current thread records its wakeup tick, then it is inserted into an ordered sleeping list and blocked. Each timer interrupt increments the global tick count and unblocks threads whose wakeup time has arrived, allowing them to resume execution without busy-waiting.

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

- It increments the global tick count and checks the front of the ordered sleeping list for threads whose wakeup time has arrived. Because the list is sorted by wakeup tick, only the earliest sleepers are examined. This minimizes iteration and keeps interrupt handling time as short as possible.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

- Race conditions are avoided by disabling interrupts whenever the shared sleeping_list is accessed or modified. In timer_sleep(), interrupts are turned off before inserting the thread and blocking (interrupts restored afterward). Since the timer interrupt handler also runs with interrupts disabled, both functions can safely access the list without interference. This prevents modifications made at the same time.

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

- Race conditions are avoided by disabling interrupts (using intr_disable() ), before modifying the shared sleeping_list inside timer_sleep(). This prevents the timer interrupt handler from accessing or changing the list at the same time. Since the interrupt handler also runs with interrupts disabled by default, both functions are protected from access to shared data at the same time.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

- I used the sleeping threads/sleep list design because it allows the CPU to perform other work instead of repeatedly checking wakeup times. Compared to the busy-waiting design, the sleep list design drastically reduces wasted CPU cycles. It's also simpler than using semaphores, which would require extra sync logic.

			 PRIORITY SCHEDULING
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>> .png file.)

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid
>> this race?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future quarters or the remaining projects?

>> Any other comments?
